                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my website, thanks for taking the time to have a look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Raymond Davies, a software developer currently working at <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> in Edinburgh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I started my journey as a .NET developer I've since worked on numerous projects using a variety of technologies.
                    Recently I've been working in AWS with Python and Java to build an "Experimentation & Configuration" platform at Skyscanner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in how to construct and enable high performance teams, in addition to the technology those teams use to build great software.
                    I think these are really important topics in understanding how to deliver "the right features, in the right way, at scale".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please take a look at my technical blog over at <a href="https://radavies.wordpress.com/"
                                                                       target="_blank">radavies.wordpress.com</a> and my github account at <a href="https://github.com/radavies/"

                        I've been at <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> since 2014.
                        Skyscanner is travel meta search brand offering flights, hotels and carhire comparison tools to more than 50 million unique visitors every month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the best things about working at Skyscanner is developing software at huge scale and having my code in-front millions of people each day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of my time at Skyscanner has been spent working on what we call the "Web Platform". This is a set of services which work together to build and serve the pages you see on the site (using components built by other teams - such as the search controls).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More recently I lead the development of a <a href="http://codevoyagers.com/2016/01/08/configuration-as-a-service/" target="_blank">real time configuration service</a> which allows teams to modify their services on the fly without releasing new code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm now part of the "Experimentation Services Squad".  As a team we're responsible for building Skyscanner's Experimentation and Configuration platform going forward - an exciting, interesting but challenging task.

					<p>
                        In 2011 I moved to <a href="http://www.lettingweb.com" target="_blank">Lettingweb</a> - a leading UK property portal, specialising in the lettings market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my first 6 months with Lettingweb I developed and launched a totally new website with supporting IT infrastructure.
                    </p>
					<p>
                        After the success of this release I became Lead Developer at Lettingweb, overseeing the entire IT and technical operation of the company.  This involved launching several new products including <a href="http://www.myrentalcv.com/" target="_blank">myrentalcv.com</a> and <a href="http://www.lettingdigital.com" target="_blank">Lettingdigital.com</a>, while continuing the development of <a href="http://www.lettingweb.com" target="_blank">Lettingweb.com</a>.
                    </p>
					<p>
                        Working at Lettingweb was very exciting, allowing me to not only cut me teeth on the latest technologies, but also giving my the freedom to choose the best of these technologies for the any given job.
                    </p>
					<p>
                        It also was during this time I was given my first taste of management, eventually managing a team of 4.

                        My first taste of commercial software development came during an internship which I arranged between my 3rd and 4th year of university.
                        During my internship at <a href="http://www.woodgroup.com/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Wood Group GTS in Aberdeen</a>
                        I developed an in house risk assessment tool, taking it from inception to release with real internal customers within 4 months.
                        I really relished the opportunity to deliver software with tight deadlines, putting to use what I'd been learning at university and working with the experienced developers working at Wood Group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I'd graduated I secured my first full time development position at <a href="http://www.rushmorereviews.com/livemarketing/" target="_blank">Rushmore Reviews</a>, again in Aberdeen.
                        At Rushmore I was brought in as a member of a new team tasked with redeveloping the company's tools and product from the ground up.
                        This was an interesting chance to be involved in a green field project from the beginning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I later moved to <a href="http://aviancommunicationsnetwork.co.uk/" target="_blank">Avian</a>, a digital marketing agency in Dundee.
                        Working with a plethora of different clients using different platforms and technologies was a great way to gain a lot of experience and skill in a short space of time.

                    Outside of work I'm a drummer, keen homebrewer / beer geek, football fan, board & video game player, sci-fi fan, car and motor sport fan, tinkerer and amateur photographer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've played in loads of bands over the years, gigging up and down Scotland. However, I'm currently playing in blues rock three piece - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fightrobotsfight" target="_blank">Fight, Robots! Fight!</a>.

                <p>
                    As a bit of a beer geek my post work drink is more likely to be a lambic than a lager.
                    I try to brew my own beer as often as possible and occasionally write about it over at my <a href="https://radbrewing.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">homebrewing blog</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a <a href="http://dufc.co/" target="_blank">Dundee United</a> and Scotland football fan and enjoy a weekly game of 5s or 7s. Recently I was down in Derby with Skyscannr for the "Aviation Cup", an annual 5s tournament.

                <p>
                    You might also find me sliding round the Nurburgring on my Xbox, watching an episode of Star Trek, building something with a Raspberry Pi or developing a few photos taken on my travels.
